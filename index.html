    <h1>Tensor Architectures and Knots</h1>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>In Belgium, are the sciences of mirrors and tree training, enter UOL, the sciences of Belgium parallel ported to the new world, the quantum mirror and tree transplantation and acupunture, the programmable smart mirror and trees!</p>

    <p>Tensors describe the new face of A.I as we define the complexity of Tensor Architectures in E8 space, the many hidden worlds of a quantum mirror, made with a quantum display, as the world is inverted and reflected are many hidden worlds, spaces spanned by knots, we define the equivalence between a knot based regression and tensor models in approximationism and the many hidden spaces, for life. </p>

    <p> BEAM and MFA II architectures are defined in Tensor Architectures as diagrams have a directed graph and Tensor Architecture. Topologies of Nv and Nu neurons can be defined and built on Wolfram. </p>

    <h4>Tensor Decomposition for Directed Graphs.</h4>
    <p>Alexander Schrijver, describes a tensor formulation for directed graphs applied to bicore, tricore and multicore models of beam ciruits.
